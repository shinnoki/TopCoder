Problem Statement

     Little Fox Jiro is standing at the bottom of a long flight of stairs. The
     bottom of the stairs has number 0, the bottommost step has number 1, the
     next step has number 2, and so on. The staircase is so long that Jiro is
     guaranteed not to reach its top.
     Jiro will now perform N consecutive actions. The actions are numbered 1
     through N, in order. When performing action X, Jiro chooses between two
     options: either he does nothing, or he jumps exactly X steps up the
     stairs. In other words, if Jiro starts performing action X standing on
     step Y, he will end it either on step Y, or on step Y+X.
     For example, if N=3, Jiro will make three consecutive choices: whether or
     not to jump 1 step upwards, 2 steps upwards, and then 3 steps upwards.
     One of the steps is broken. The number of this step is badStep. Jiro
     cannot jump onto this step.
     You are given the ints N and badStep. Compute and return the number of the
     topmost step that can be reached by Jiro.

Definition


     Class:            JumpFurther
     Method:           furthest
     Parameters:       int, int
     Returns:          int
     Method signature: int furthest(int N, int badStep)
     (be sure your method is public)

    

Constraints

  -  N will be between 1 and 2,000, inclusive.
  -  badStep will be between 1 and 4,000,000, inclusive.

Examples

       2


       2

    

       Returns: 3


     The optimal strategy is to jump upwards twice: from step 0 to step 1,
     and then from step 1 to step 3. This trajectory avoids the broken step.


 1)



       2


       1

    

       Returns: 2


     In this case step 1 is broken, so Jiro cannot jump upwards as his first
     action. The optimal strategy is to first stay on step 0, and then to
     jump from step 0 to step 2.


 2)



       3


       3
    


       Returns: 5
